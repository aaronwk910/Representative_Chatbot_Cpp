This program is intended to take as input a question about the representative through the command line. The 
program then sends the answer out to the user via the command line as well.

First, the program creates an instance of the class representative named r1. Then it parses the input file
by header to populate the values within r1. Then in the main function, the user is prompted to ask a question.

This question, so long as it isnt "quit" or "q"(case insensitive), will be fed to r1.processQuestion. This
function takes in a string and uses regex to determine what type of information is being requested. It then
sends a request to r1.answerQuestion, which takes in an input string asking for a type of information and
outputs that information as a string. The main function then displays this string for the user and prompts
them for another question!
