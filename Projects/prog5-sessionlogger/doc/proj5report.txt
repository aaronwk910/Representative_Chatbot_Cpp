This program is an extension of the previous chatbot programs. The functionality added in
this program allows for different arguments to the program, "showchat", "summary", and
"showchat-summary", which show different statistics regarding stored chat sessions from the past.

Valid inputs and expected outputs can be found in the test folder. 

Due to an issue with Eclipse, my files are currently not being sent to data/chat_sessions but are
instead only being sent to data/, as they are not recognized when located within the chat_sessions
directory.
