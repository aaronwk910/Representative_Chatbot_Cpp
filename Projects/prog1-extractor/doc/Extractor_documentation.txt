This program is intended to extract the relevant data from district_92_data.txt and store it as variables
in the r1 instance of the representative class defined in the representative92 header and usage files.
The main program is labeled as district_92_data_storage.cpp.

This program takes as input from the user the name of the district in question. If the district is 92,
Berkeley, or Berkeley County, the program will extract the data on this district's representative, store
it inside of the r1 instance of the representative class, and output the data to console to signal success.
It also outputs statistics on the input file at the end of the output! In practice, the program will not
output the data stored in r1, but will simply use it to answer user questions.

Sample input and output are located in the test folder in sample_io.txt
